# FIFA Football Data Analysis

=======

Our project delves into the fascinating world of football data analysis, using the comprehensive EA Sports'24 dataset. EA Sports, a division of the renowned video game company Electronic Arts Inc., specializes in creating and publishing sports video games that faithfully replicate real-world sports experiences. Our dataset spans a decade from 2014 to 2024, covering player statistics from these games.

By applying advanced data analytics techniques, we uncover actionable insights that provide a deeper understanding of the virtual footballing universe created by EA Sports. Using this dataset, we explore trends, player performance, and evolution over time, helping bridge the gap between virtual gaming and real-world football. This project serves as a testament to the powerful insights that data science can extract from seemingly simple gaming datasets, revealing valuable lessons and trends in both the gaming and real-world football communities.
